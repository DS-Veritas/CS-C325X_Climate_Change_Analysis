### Motivation
Advancements in the Earth Observation (EO) technology, such as satellite systems, have made it possible for researchers to see the bigger picture of climate change 
by providing various types of information, such as physical, chemical, and biological systems of the planet, about earth and its climate on a global scale.
According to research, climate change has already brought multiple observable impacts to our environment.
Glaciers have shrunk and a number of animal and plant species are in danger of extinction due to climate change.
Such impacts can fundamentally transform whole ecosystems and the intricate webs of life. Furthermore, it has a significant effect on our livelihoods, health, and future.
There is no more time to wait. Although we cannot stop climate change overnight, we still can slow down the pace of it. 
And for this, we first must understand how the climate is changing and why it is happening.

### Objectives
In this research, we examine some representative scientific evidence of climate changing, and attempt to model and extrapolate the global mean temperature using various prediction models.
